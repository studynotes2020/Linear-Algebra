    "# Linear Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many physicists don't like coordinates, they want to know what happen to all space\n",
    "\n",
    "without coordinates: matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "with coordinates -> Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do projection without coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "$T: R^2 \\to R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformation is a map between input and output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rules of Linear Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $T(v + w) = T(v) + T(w)$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $T(cv) = cT(v)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $T(cv + dw) = cT(v) + dT(w)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Shift whole plane\n",
    "\n",
    "Every vector $\\vec v$, shift them by $v_0$. Is this transformation linear?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. If double the length of $\\vec v$, the transformation still goes $v_0$, not double of $v_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, $T(0) = 0$ is a linear transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "$T(v) = ||v||, T: R^3 \\to R$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that zero vector goes to zero. Also double v, double length. But  v multiply by minus 2, the length does not multiply by minus 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Rotation by $45^o$\n",
    "\n",
    "$T: R^2 \\to R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$T(v)$ rotate $v$ by $45^o$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe this without coordinates. If add then rotate, transformation also add and rotate. If double length, transformation also double length\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4: Matrix A\n",
    "\n",
    "$T(v) = Av$\n",

    "This is a linear transformation\n",

    "We know RHS, then we know LHS\n",
    "\n",

    "## Coordinates come from a basis\n",
    "\n",
    "Coordinate of $v = c_1v_1 + ... + c_nv_n$\n",

    "If I change the basis, I change the coordinate. We have always been assuming we are working with standard basis.\n",
